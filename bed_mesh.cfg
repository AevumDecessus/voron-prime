[bed_mesh]
speed: 250
# The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
# The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 15
# The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
# just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
mesh_min: 30,30
# Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
# beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
# will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
# parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
mesh_max: 320,320
# Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
# beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
# be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
# must be provided for rectangular beds.
probe_count: 9,9
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
fade_end: 10.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
# The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
# This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
# is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
algorithm: bicubic
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
#adaptive_margin:
#   An optional margin (in mm) to be added around the bed area used by
#   the defined print objects when generating an adaptive mesh.
scan_overshoot: 30
#  The maximum amount of travel (in mm) available outside of the mesh.
#  For rectangular beds this applies to travel on the X axis, and for round beds
#  it applies to the entire radius.  The tool must be able to travel the amount
#  specified outside of the mesh.  This value is used to optimize the travel
#  path when performing a "rapid scan".  The minimum value that may be specified
#  is 1.  The default is no overshoot.
